# cinema-ticket-system
Hello, this is super simple project to showcase how authorisation and ticket purchases work in the cinema. 

# Files
cinema_ticket_system.py - is where the core functionality of the Cinema Ticket System located.

testcase1.py - is simply file that I used to check that all the functions are working properly and in case if you don't want to waste time on checking the menu.py you can simply run it instead.

menu.py - is the file you would probably will open to check how this application performs.

# How to use
This is terminal based application, so I expect you know how to use terminal. 

First of all, after you download the files to your machine or clone the repo using "git clone" command, I want you to open your terminal/console and make sure python packages are installed.

You do that by typing to your console/terminal "python --version" and if you have it installed it will show you the version of python installed.

Next I want you to go to the location of the "menu.py" file. For example:
cd /home/zhk/git/cinema-ticket-system/

and then simply write this command: python menu.py

or you can simply start it by writing python and path to your directory next to it. For me it looks like this:
python /home/zhk/git/cinema-ticket-system/menu.py

After you run the file it is pretty easy to use it. Just select the option you want to test by writing the number from 1 to 5 to the command line and 6 if you want exit the menu.py.
